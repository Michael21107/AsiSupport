* The versions manifest has been updated (up to version 1.0.2060.0)

- SHVDN support has been removed as it is obsolete. A new support might be added in the future.

__0.4.1__
* SHVDN support is now disabled by default (because of its instability)
* The versions manifest has been updated (up to version 1.0.1868.1)
* Process corrupted state exceptions (ie: AccessViolations) are now properly handled.

__0.4.0__
* The maximum number of native arguments has been increased from 25 to 32
* All argument buffers are now pre-allocated: this should improve the plugin's overall performance
+ ScriptHookVDotNet support added

__0.3.3__
* The plugin can now optionally consider the current game version as unknown (getGameVersion() then always returns -1)
* The plugin can now optionally ignore calls to unknown natives. This could prevent some plugins from crashing. If a plugin tries to call an unknown native, 0 will be returned.
* Added the ReloadAsiConfig command

__0.3.2__
* The plugin should no longer crash if it failed to load or convert an ASI file
* The plugin now detects non ScriptHookV scripts instead of trying to convert them

__0.3.1__
* Improved performance

__0.3.0__
* The AsiSupport plugin has been rewritten in C# to remove the C++/CLI dependency
* The interop with ASI scripts is now done via UnvAsiIntrf.dll (coded in pure C++)
* AsiSupport no longer uses .rasi files: it uses .uasi (Universal ASI) files
* Converting ASI files to UASI should now be faster
* Key events are no longer being transferred to ASI plugins when the RPH console is open
* Better handling of exceptions: the plugin should no longer crash (most of the times), but instead show a user friendly error message
* Most ASI plugins can now be unloaded and reloaded without rebooting the game (sorry, ELS is not one of them)
* Some previously hardcoded values are now read in an external, easily editable file
* The crash reporting system has been improved

__0.2.0__
* If a script is already loaded with SHV, the SHV script will be killed
* The dependency issue is now fixed
* The plugin should now also work on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1
* OpenIV.asi is no longer handled as it is stand-alone and will work anyway
* If the original .asi file changes, the converted .rasi file is updated

__0.1.0__
+ Initial public release
